# Create a Local Certificate Issuer



A Local Certificate Issuer enables you to issue certificates from a certdog controlled CA

A Certificate Issuer combines a CA (Certificate Authority) and Certificate Profile  

  

### 1. Create a Local CA Configuration  
   Select **Local CA** > **Configuration** from the menu and click **Add New CA**

<img src=".\images\new-local-ca.png" alt="image-20210620112307746" style="zoom: 67%;" />

Complete the following details:  

<u>Main Certificate Authority Details</u>  

* **CA Name**: Enter a name for this CA

* **Type**: You can create a Root CA (self-signed) or an Intermediate CA (if a Root CA has been configured). A complete hierarchy of CAs can be configured with no limit to the chain length  

* **Issuer**: If you select Intermediate CA in the option above, a list of available parent CAs (issuers) will be displayed. Select the CA to be the parent/issuer CA

* **Subject DN**: Enter the CA Distinguished Name

* **Lifetime**: Specify the life of this CA. Note that if an Intermediate CA's lifetime is set to exceed that of the issuer, it will be automatically reduced to be equal to the issuers. I.e. you cannot issue an Intermediate CA with a longer life than its parent

* **Algorithm**: Select RSA or ECDSA as the algorithm used to generate the CA keys

* **Key Size**: If RSA is selected, set the RSA key size

* **Curve**: If ECDSA is selected, set the name for the elliptic curve

* **Hash Algorithm**: Set the CA's hash algorithm

Note that once the CA is configured the above options are fixed and cannot then be changed. You may delete and re-issue a CA but you cannot change its lifetime, algorithm etc.   

<u>Extensions</u>  

* **CRL Distribution Points**: Enter a URL (or list of URLs separated by commas). These locations will be included in the CRL Distribution Points extension of all certificates issued by this CA and relate to where the CRL issued by this CA can be obtained
* **AIA OCSP Locations**: Enter a URL (or list of OCSP URLs separated by commas). These locations will be included in the AIA (Authority Information Access) extension of all certificates issued by this CA and relate to where the certificate status can be obtained via OCSP
* **AIA Issuer Cert Locations**: Enter a URL (or list of URLs separated by commas). These locations will be included in the AIA (Authority Information Access) extension of all certificates issued by this CA and relate to where the CA certificate can be obtained

<u>CRL Generation</u>  

* **Generate CRLs**: If you want this CA to generate CRLs, enable this option

* **CRL Lifetime**: This is the lifetime of the CRL i.e. the period between the *Effective date* and *Next update* values in the CRL

* **CRL Generation Period**: This is how often you want the CRL to be generated. It must be less than the CRL Lifetime. For example, if the lifetime were set to 2 days, you may set this to 1 day so there is always a 1 day overlap

* **CRL Filename**: This is the location the CRL file will be placed when generated

  

Click **Create**   

(The Extensions and CRL Generation options can be edited later if required)  

  

  

**Notes on the CRL Filename and CRL Distribution Points**  

A CRL must be available at the location(s) specified in the CRL Distribution points. You must therefore ensure that the CRL generated at the location specified by CRL Filename is either the location the CRL Distribution Point references, or is  copied to this location  

One option is to use the certdog web server to host this CRL. To do this perform the following steps:  

1. On the file-system navigate to where certdog is installed e.g. ``c:\certdog``

2. Create a CRL folder within the webapps of the tomcat instance (that hosts certdog). I.e. create the following folder:

   ``c:\certdog\tomcat\webapps\crl``

3. Set the CRL Distribution point to be: ``http://[your URL]/crl/ca.crl`` e.g. ``http://certdog.net/crl/ca.crl``

4. Set the CRL Filename to be: ``c:\certdog\tomcat\webapps\crl\ca.crl``

This will result in the CRL being created at ``c:\certdog\tomcat\webapps\crl\ca.crl`` which will then be available at this URL: ``http://certdog.net/crl/ca.crl``

### 2. Create a Certificate Profile

   Select **Local CA** > **Profiles** from the menu and click **Add New Profile**

<img src=".\images\new_localca_profiles2.png" alt="image-20210620123244374" style="zoom: 67%;" />

* And enter a **Profile Name**

* Select the **lifetime**.  This will be the lifetime of the issued certificate

* If you wish SANs (Subject Alternative Names) that are provided in the CSR (Certificate Signing Request) to be included in any issued certificates, ensure the **Include SANs from CSR** option is checked  

* Select the **Key Usages** - these will be applied to the issued certificate

* Select the **Enhanced Key Usages** - these will be applied to the issued certificate  

* If this is to be an OCSP certificate and you do not wish the status of this certificate to be checked. Set the **Include OCSP No Check** option

See [RFC5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280) for more details on key usages  

Click **Add**  

   

### 3. Create a Certificate Issuer

Select **Certificate Issuers** from the menu

<img src=".\images\new_ms_issuer.png" alt="image-20210108170849399" style="zoom:67%;" />

Click **Add New Issuer**

<img src=".\images\new_localca_issuer2.png" alt="image-20210108170947087" style="zoom:67%;" />

From the drop down select **Local CA** and click **Next**

<img src=".\images\new_localca_issuer3.png" alt="image-20210620124010018" style="zoom:67%;" />

Enter a **Name** and select the **Local Configuration** and **Certificate Profile** as just created from the drop downs  

Select the **Team**(s) that will be authorised to use this issuer. Members of these teams will be able to issue and revoke certificates  

Click **Add**  



If you wish to request a certificate by just providing a DN i.e. with certdog generating the CSR on your behalf, then a CSR Generator must be available.  See [Create a CSR Generator](create_csr_generator.html)
