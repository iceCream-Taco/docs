> **Version 1.6.0**
> **Release Date**: 31 January 2022
>
> **Updates**

* Certificate details now displays: key size (or curve name), thumbprint, policies, AIA and CDPs

* Revoked certificates are now displayed with a red outline

* Credentials cannot be deleted if in use

* When installing, the port can now be specified as well as the listening IP address

* CRLs are now hosted on an http site by default (previously they were https by default)

* Certificate search now retains number of certificates to display

* Additional email addresses can be added for cert issued and expiry reminder emails

* Emails can be suppressed for individual teams

* Saved searches are now available via a drop down and the search is executed as selected

* DN can now be entered as components (CN, O, OU etc.)

* Email sending can be switched off per server (in the case of multiple servers running)

* Admin users can navigate to team and user details from detailed certificate view

* Can now control access via IP address (including ranges and wildcards) per team

* Existing CA imports via PFX/P12 improved

* Microsoft CA certificate import improved and now stores template with certs when imported

* More efficient handling for large numbers of certificates (20k+)

  **Security Updates**:

  * Log4j2 version upped to 2.17.1
  * User disable and delay added for failed login attempts

  

**Fixes** 

* When Active selected in search - all certificates were returned
* If a CA P12 import password used the 'Â£' character import failed. This was due to encoding in the PowerShell module
* The Certdog service failed to locate the API location on some installations (requiring a workaround) 
* P12 Import occasionally failed when mapping to a Key Store that had non-ASCII passwords 
* Once a Local CA is using a Key Store, the password could still be changed - this is now prevented
* Import Cert for a user (not admin) would produce an unauthorised response
* ADCS driver required a credential with local logon. This is no longer needed
