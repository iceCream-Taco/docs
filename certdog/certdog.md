# Certdog

certdog enables the almost instant issuance of certificates from the in-built Local CA, PrimeKey's EJBCA and Microsoft ADCS instances, providing automation and management  

All operations can be automated via the REST API  

certdog can be deployed as a container ([get the demo docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/krestfield/certdog)), stand-alone or distributed across infrastructure on Windows, Linux and MacOS  

Manage all your EJBCA and Microsoft CAs centrally, tracking all certificates for expiry, notifying users and making use of the automation to renew when expiring
