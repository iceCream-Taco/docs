# Certdog

certdog is a CA (Certificate Authority) and Certificate Management system that can be deployed in minutes to Windows and Linux based operating systems  

It is able to host its own CAs - allowing for multiple hierarchies, providing both CRL and OCSP services

It can also interface to your existing Microsoft AD CS or PrimeKey EJBCA instances

Certificates can be issued via the Console, REST API or PowerShell scripts. The REST API offers full certificate management and system management capabilities allowing for full automation

Certificates are managed throughout their entire lifecycle, with configurable alerts when nearing expiry and the ability to renew
