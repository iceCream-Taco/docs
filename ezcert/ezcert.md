# EzCert

EzCert enables the almost instant issuance of certificates from the internal Local CA and your Microsoft ADCS instances providing automation and management  

All operations can be automated via the REST API  

EzCert can be deployed as a container ([get the demo docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/krestfield/ezcert)), stand-alone or distributed across infrastructure on Windows, Linux and MacOS  

You can start a docker instance, create a CA and add the new root to your trusted store.  Distribute certificates to your other instances for TLS, RDP, User Authentication etc. using the REST API then tear everything down and start again  

Alternatively, you can manage all your Microsoft CAs centrally, tracking all certificates for expiry, notifying users and making use of the automation to renew when expiring
