# Set Permissions on a Certificate Issuer



This guide details how you set permissions for a user on a *Certificate Issuer*  

A user that has permissions on an issuer is able to request and revoke certificates from that issuer  



You must be an Administrator to perform this step. If you are not then you must request that an Administrator update your account with the required permissions, as detailed below



Permissions on Certificate Issuers are granted via Teams. There are two options to gain the required permissions:

1. Add the user to a Team that already has the required *Certificate Issuer* configured

   To add a user to an existing team, see the section *Add a User to a Team* [here](teams.html)

2. Create a new team and then add the user to this team

   See [here](teams.html) for details on how to create a new team

3. Update an existing Team to include the Certificate Issuer, then add the user to this team. Details on this are below:
